---------------------------package.json----------------------------
"scripts" "build" is not used since we are using "type":"module",
So there is no need of babel.

Hence "server" script has been changed from:
"server": "node --trace-warnings --watch dist/index.js"
to
"server": "node --trace-warnings --watch src/index.js"

AND

"start" script has been changed from:
"start": "concurrently \"npm run build\" \"npm run server\""
to
"start": "npm run server"
